	A few reviews on some movies I watched recently. All movies in this list are my personal recommendations.

	<br> <br>

<ul class="minus-list">
	<li>Tokyo Sonata (2008) - Kyoshi Kurosawa</li>
	<br> <br>

	<div class="movie-poster">

	This is the first movie I watched from the director Kyoshi Kurosawa and also unfortunately, the only good one in my personal opinion. I haven't watched all of them so this can still change. The premise of the movie, a family father losing his job, who fears telling his family about it, and has to hide it, by still seemingly going to work everyday, was really intringuing. The movie offered much more than that. The element of music, with the son who has a gift for piano, brings an element of pure beauty, in the otherwise catastophic family situation, and really show a magnificient contrast of two worlds.

	<li>The Man Who Knew Infinity (2015) - Matthew Brown</li>

	I didn't pick this movie with a lot of thoughts so I hadn't any expectations about it. I was pleastly suprised, the movie felt really well paced. I have watched a few movies about mathematicians now. But this one is definitely in my top 3. Ramanujan was a genius of mathematics, no doubts about that, but he was not a god which sometimes this kind of movie want to portray. It also showed his weaknesses. The period is also interesting, UK in the First World War. We can see the situation in an university during that period. The faculty members are also all very excentric, comical and interesting. This was a pleasant suprise and I would really recommend to watch it if it's not done yet.
